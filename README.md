# Css Negative Margins for Bootstrap v5 installed with CDN

Useful if you use [Bootstrap v5 CDN](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/#cdn-links) and don't use Sass files in your project. 

In [Bootstrap 5 Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/#negative-margin) you can find that negative margins are disabled by default and you can enable them with Sass variables.
If you need ***pure CSS*** classes you can use this repo.

You can just integrate these classes in the bootstrap.min.css file (*unminify it and look for each media query, insert these classes and [minify](https://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/) it again, or simply add them at the end of the file*) or copy them in your own style.css.


*In VsCode ["Comment Anchor"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExodiusStudios.comment-anchors) Extension can help to navigate the file.*

Hope it can help! :gift: :sos: :blush:
